Earlier today, my brother was asking me for a laptop recommendation. This is a relatively normal interaction, however upon recommending the 2021 14" MacBook Pro again, for perhaps the sixth time since its release, it made me reflect upon the laptop landscape.

Despite new offerings and yearly refreshes by Apple, I can confidently say that, in Q3 2024, the 14" M1 Pro MacBook Pro is the best value laptop on the market.
