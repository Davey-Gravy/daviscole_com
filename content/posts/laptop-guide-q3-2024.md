To qualify my statements below, please read [My Computer History](/posts/my-computer-history.md/).

Earlier today, my brother was asking me for a laptop recommendation. This is a relatively normal interaction, however upon recommending the 2021 14" MacBook Pro again, for perhaps the sixth time since its release, it made me reflect upon the laptop landscape.

Despite new offerings and yearly refreshes by Apple, I can confidently say that, in Q3 2024, the 14" M1 Pro MacBook Pro is the best value laptop on the market.

In `<current year>`, if you live in the US of A and are under the age of 40, you likely use an iPhone. I would imagine most people would want to take advantagse of Apple's walled garden, which includes:

- iMessage
- FaceTime
- AirDrop
- Apple Pay
- iCloud Photos

and more. This certainly will be an incentive to lean towards a MacBook.

The introduction of the M-series chips is what really sells me on MacBooks. 

These chips offer equivalent performance to some desktop platforms with the power draw of a tablet. This addresses two of my biggest issues with Windows laptops: battery life, and overheating.

When you close your laptop lid, you expect your laptop to sleep, right? I can't count how many times I've packed my laptop -- fully charged -- into my bag for class, only to find it at 50% just from the walk. I've felt heat radiating from my laptop sleeve into my back, just from the laptop, doing nothing?

I've certainly felt laptop chassis warm enough to fry an egg.

Disregarding sleep state shenanigans, I would expect previous laptops to get me through class with conservative usage, and I mean *conservative*; no browsing reddit or online shopping, no YouTube, just my notes app and paying attention to the lecture. To this day, I habitually carry a laptop charger in my bag, expecting that I'd run out of juice while on the go (USB-C charging has made this much less painful)
